## What is an Authenticator App?
The Authenticator app works like a special lock for your online accounts, such as your bank account. When you sign in to your account, the website requires two things to ensure it's really you: your password and your phone. If someone tries to access your account without your phone, they won't be able to do it! The app sends a fast notification to your phone, and all you need to do is tap "Yes" to verify it's you, or type in a few random numbers the app provides. 

> You might be familiar with the process of receiving text messages from accounts to confirm your identity. Well, the Authenticator app operates on a similar idea, but it's even easier and more secure.

It's that simple and secure, adding an extra layer of protection to keep your accounts safe from unauthorized access. With the Authenticator app, you can rest easy knowing your online accounts are well-guarded!

The Microsoft Authenticator App is linked to your phone for added security. If you ever upgrade to a new phone, it's essential to have your old phone handy to facilitate the transfer of your accounts. Additionally, some websites offer "Recovery Codes" as a precautionary measure in case you lose access to your phone. Remember to keep these codes safe and secure in case you ever need to use them.
