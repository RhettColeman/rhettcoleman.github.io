## What is an Authenticator App?
The Authenticator app works like a special lock for your online accounts, such as your bank account. When you sign in to your account, the website requires two things to ensure it's really you: your password and your phone. If someone tries to access your account without your phone, they won't be able to do it! The app sends a fast notification to your phone, and all you need to do is tap "Yes" to verify it's you, or type in a few random numbers the app provides. 

> You might be familiar with the process of receiving text messages from accounts to confirm your identity. Well, the Authenticator app operates on a similar idea, but it's even easier and more secure..
