## Overview
Whether it's binge-watching our favorite shows, enjoying movies, or exploring new web series, online platforms have revolutionized the way we consume entertainment. However, constantly moving your laptop from one room to another can be quite a hassle. To tackle this issue, I decided to transform my Raspberry Pi 4 into a dedicated media center. In this blog post, I will share my experience and guide you through the process of setting up your own media center using a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Why Raspberry Pi 4?
The Raspberry Pi 4 is a versatile and affordable (Less than $100!) single-board computer that can be easily turned into a media center. It offers significant processing power, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and supports various multimedia formats. Its small form factor makes it perfect for creating a compact and energy-efficient media center without compromising on functionality.

## Installing the operating system
### Raspberry Pi Os vs Ubuntu
I chose Ubuntu for my Raspberry Pi over Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) due to its regular updates, security, extensive software repository, ongoing support, and flexibility for customization. You can learn more about the differences in this [**Linux Hint**](https://linuxhint.com/raspberry-pi-os-vs-ubuntu/) article.

While there are other minimal operating systems available to turn your Raspberry Pi into a media center, I personally prefer having a computer-like device connected to my TV rather than relying on smart tv like interface.

> You may perform this project with Raspberry Pi OS if you wish.

## Ubuntu installation
Ubuntu offers an official operating system specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi 4. This version of Ubuntu, known as Ubuntu Desktop for Raspberry Pi 4, provides a fully functional desktop environment optimized for the Raspberry Pi 4's hardware capabilities.

To ensure that the step-by-step instructions for installing Ubuntu Desktop on Raspberry Pi 4 remain up-to-date, it is best to refer to the official documentation provided Ubuntu. They have comprehensive and regularly updated instructions on how to install Ubuntu Desktop for Raspberry Pi 4.

You can find the official installation guide for Ubuntu Desktop on Raspberry Pi 4 by visiting the following link: [**Ubuntu Desktop for Raspberry Pi**](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-4#1-overview)

> Installing Ubuntu on your Raspberry Pi is usually straightforward, but keep in mind that it can take a while for the installation process to complete.
{: .prompt-warning }

During the initial login to Ubuntu, you will be prompted to create a profile with a username. In this case, let's choose the username "media" for your profile. Create a password and ensure you save it, as we will need it later for various configurations and access to your media center.

## Media Content
With Ubuntu installed on your Raspberry Pi and connected to your TV, you now have a powerful media console at your disposal. Utilizing Ubuntu's capabilities, you can use Firefox browser to access and watch online content just like you would on any computer. Whether it's streaming videos, browsing websites, or enjoying online entertainment, you have the flexibility to explore a wide range of content directly from your Raspberry Pi media console.

If you desire a more smart TV-like experience with a dedicated media center interface, you can also explore Kodi. Kodi offers a user-friendly interface specifically designed for media consumption, providing access to a vast library of movies, TV shows, music, and more. By installing Kodi on your Raspberry Pi, you can enhance your media center experience and enjoy a tailored smart TV-like interface for convenient content streaming and organization.

Whether you choose to use Firefox for a computer-like browsing experience or opt for Kodi to create a dedicated media center interface, Ubuntu on your Raspberry Pi opens up endless possibilities for entertainment right from your TV screen.

## Kodi Media Center
[**Kodi**](https://kodi.tv/) is a popular open-source media center software that allows you to organize and stream your media content seamlessly. It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and playing various types of media, including movies, TV shows, music, and more. 

### Kodi Installation
To install Kodi on your Raspberry Pi, you have two options: you can either follow the [**official installation instructions**](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_on_Raspberry_Pi?https=1) provided by Kodi, or you can follow these steps:

- [X] Step 1: Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi.

> To open a terminal, press the Ctrl, Alt and T keys together.
{: .prompt-info }

- [X] Step 2: Update the system by entering the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
> You will be prompted to enter the password that you created during the profile setup.
{: .prompt-info }

> Linux does not display characters on the screen when entering a password. Simply type your password and press Enter when you're finished.
{: .prompt-tip }

- [X] Step 3: Install Kodi by entering the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install kodi
```
The installation process will start, and you'll be prompted to confirm the installation. Press 'Y' and hit Enter to proceed.

Once the installation is complete, you may exit out of the terminal. Kodi will be installed on your Raspberry Pi.

> Linux does not provide an indication when the installation process is complete. You will know that the installation has finished when the terminal prompt returns, allowing you to enter another command.
