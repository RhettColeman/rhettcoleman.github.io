## Master Services Agreement
The MSA is the catch all for all contract details. Other contracts such as the Statement of Work can be housed in the MSA. The MSA is best known for gorning all future transations and agreements such as:

- **Payment Terms**: Outlines the negotiated schedule of payments for the services rendered.

- **Product Warranties**: Provides assurance that a product will meet specified conditions, ensuring its quality and functionality.

- **Intellectual Property Ownership**: Defines the ownership rights of copyrights, patents, and trademarks related to the project's intellectual property.

- **Dispute Resolution**: Establishes a process for resolving disputes that may arise during the course of the project.

- **Allocation of Risk**: Clearly delineates the levels of responsibility and risk between the involved parties.

- **Indemnification**: Specifies instances where parties agree to be financially responsible for certain circumstances or damages.

- **Corporate Social Responsibility**: Addresses commitments to environmentally sustainable practices, philanthropy, and community engagement.

- **Business Ethics**: Outlines the set of moral principles and values guiding the ethical conduct of business activities.

- **Network and Facility Access**: Specifies the terms and conditions for accessing and utilizing networks and facilities related to the project.

## Nondisclosure Agreement
The nondisclosure agreement (NDA) functions as a confidentiality pact designed to safeguard a business's competitive edge by securing its proprietary information and intellectual property. It is highly advisable for a company to implement an NDA when conducting a penetration test (pentest), particularly when enlisting the services of an external vendor. In the unfortunate event of a security breach, the vendor is legally bound to uphold the confidentiality of any privileged information acquired during the pentest.

## Statement of Work
The SOW articulates the identified problem, delineates the work activities, defines project deliverables, and establishes a timeline for the completion of the work. Typically, the statement of work addresses the following subjects:
    
The subjects typically addressed in a Statement of Work (SOW) include:

- **Purpose**: Clearly outlines the reason for undertaking the project.

- **Scope of Work**: Describes in detail the work activities that are to be completed as part of the project.
  
- **Location of Work**: Specifies where the project work will be carried out.
  
- **Period of Performance**: Establishes the timeline and duration for the project.
  
- **Deliverables Schedule**: Defines the project artifacts and provides due dates for each deliverable.
  
- **Applicable Industry Standards**: Specifies any relevant industry standards or criteria that must be adhered to during the project.
  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Outlines the conditions that must be met for the project to be accepted as completed.
  
- **Special Requirements**: Covers any specific needs such as travel requirements or workforce qualifications (certifications, education).
  
- **Payment Schedule**: Details the negotiated schedule of payments, which may be derived from the Master Service Agreement (MSA).

## Rules of Engagement
A penetration test (Pentest) is governed by specific rules that the pentester must adhere to. These rules delineate the tests that the pentest is authorized to perform and specify activities that are prohibited. For instance, a company may restrict a brute-force attack on a production system.

This document necessitates approval from both the service vendor and the client, signifying the establishment and agreement upon baseline expectations. It provides additional details on topics outlined in the SOW, including:
- Scope
- Location
- Applicable industry standards
- Timelines. 

The document also defines communication and escalation paths, ensuring the pentest team knows who to contact and how in the event of an issue. Expectations for the customer may also be included.

## Permission to Test
Authorization documents for testing must be signed by an individual possessing authority over the assets undergoing testing. This authority figure must be legally empowered to approve testing terms on behalf of the asset owners in all contracts and documentation. 

These documents should explicitly authorize testing activities and establish expectations, making it clear that penetration testers bear no liability for system instability or crashes. 

Additionally, the documents should specify that the tester is committed to exercising due diligence to prevent any damage to systems during testing. Pentesters are responsible for conducting their own due diligence to ensure that the individual requesting testing possesses the requisite authority over the tested assets to approve the test or has obtained additional permission as necessary.
